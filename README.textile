This scraper scours productionhub.com for its production companies.  For each production company, it clicks its link and then obtains and parses the address into [line1, line2, city, state, zip].  It also removes text like "inc" and llc" and any trailing punctuation from the production company name.  Production companies with addresses in one line (incomplete addresses) are skipped.
